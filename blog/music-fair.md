Don’t worry, we’re not a band consisting of ten or so people, the photo above just shows most of the people involved in the non-stop performance onstage during the school fair. We took turns, switched roles, and we have genuinely enjoyed playing together, and enduring the pressure from the crowd whilst playing songs that we had barely practiced.

The microphone did not work on some occasions, the singers forgot a line in the song they were singing, the bassists not realizing their instrument was muted…etc. It was far from a flawless performance.

However, on that little red stage surrounded by food stalls, junior and senior students alike had learnt to deal with being shy and nervous in front of a crowd, got introduced to the idea of teamwork and coordination, and had demonstrated how music can connect us.
